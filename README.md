This project sets itself to make a standardized form to represent Privacy Icon across websites.
Presently, it demos [my take on the privacy icon proposal](http://debloper.blogspot.com/p/privacy-icon.html "Link to the blog-page."), it's just a crude draft of the (trying-to-make-it-a) specification.
It being a damn long read (yeah, I overwhelmed myself), I've decided to take a [show-&-tell](http://debloper.github.com/privacy.js "Live demo!") approach to explain it, and make a JS Polyfill around it as well.

If you've landed here without any prior idea about the topic, then please read about [Privacy Icon Project](https://www.drumbeat.org/project/privacy-icons "Privacy Icon - Drumbeat"), and also [Aza Raskin's writeup](http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/privacy-icons/ "Aza Raskin's Blog Post"), to have a lead.
